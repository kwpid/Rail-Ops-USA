- update paint system a little further:
have it so paint schemes can be removed / changed on locomotives (this is to help with the additions below)
Heritage / Special Schemes + Special Liveries will mostly be used with this, as players may move them around to newer or betteer locomotives.

add a refresh timer to the loaner train marketplace, and ensure trains her show up (not showing up currently, but it could becuase a refresh hasnt happened just yet)

add an achievment/task system, with a new currency called "Points" (players start with 10)

3 types of achievments:
Weekly, Career, Event
Weekly are just tasks that can be completed for money and or points
10 different tasks/challenges per week (resets every friday @ 12 PM)
challenges can be like: Complete 5 Intermodal Jobs, Complete 15 Mainline Jobs, etc
some can give 5000-1000 cash, harder ones give ~25-50k, and some points (most is 25)

Career achieevements are things that can be completed throughout playing the game (tehse dont reset)
Such as:
Have 1,000,000 or more cash in your accouunt (Reward: 50 ponts)
Have 10,000,000 or more cash in your account (Reward: 250 points)
etc
have at least 20 of these

Event will be up to developers (have a file to create event rewards easily)
Event rewards only last for a specified amount of time, and can be specific challenges
For now, have the "ALPHA CHALLENGE", (for alpha testers)

Challenges / Tasks:
Complete 5 Intermodal Jobs (+5 points, +7,500 Cash)
Complete 15 Local Freight Jobs (+10,000 Cash)
Complete 5 Mainline Jobs (+15,000 Cash)
[add a few more challenges here]
Complete 250 Total Jobs (+500,000 Cash, 200 Points, and a special livery: "Alpha Livery")
liveries are a paint scheme, these can only be applied to locomotive
this even ends on December 1st, 2025 @ 12 pm




What can points be used for?
- points can be used to auto-complete jobs instead of waiting (10 points to do this)
- points can be used to auto-complete painting trains (5 points, and this does work for all trains, mneaning if i repaint my entire fleet, then redeem 5 points to complete, it completes all paints)
-  points can be used to purchase heritage / paint schemes (more info below)

Heritage / Special Paint Schemes:
- have a similiar thing to paint scheme, but a  bit more detailed / expensive
- requires level 25 minium, up to 500,000 cash, and 100-150 points for a single paint scheme
- can only be applied to a single locomotive in the fleet (players choice)
- this locomotive will have a special styling for its card (based off paint colors), as well a gradient animation for the trains #'s on jobs, and such
