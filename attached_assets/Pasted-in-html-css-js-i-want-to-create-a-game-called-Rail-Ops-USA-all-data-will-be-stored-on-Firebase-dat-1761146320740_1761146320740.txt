in html/css/js i want to create a game called Rail Ops: USA

all data will be stored on Firebase database;
<script type="module">
  // Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
  import { initializeApp } from "https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/12.4.0/firebase-app.js";
  import { getAnalytics } from "https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/12.4.0/firebase-analytics.js";
  // TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
  // https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

  // Your web app's Firebase configuration
  // For Firebase JS SDK v7.20.0 and later, measurementId is optional
  const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyBEHyI05k2kDJBv2-poPENpWivzLsGmjME",
    authDomain: "train-manager-2.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "train-manager-2",
    storageBucket: "train-manager-2.firebasestorage.app",
    messagingSenderId: "92471782431",
    appId: "1:92471782431:web:fd36abf945b5e5dcfff92a",
    measurementId: "G-01NKBXGHE3"
  };

  // Initialize Firebase
  const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
  const analytics = getAnalytics(app);
</script>

- create databases dynamically, so first user = databses created

we will use google auth / login for signing up / logging in. username will be the players username
ensure the google login/signup is a popup

ensure when they login they stay logged in until they sign out

also provide the firestore rules needed

ensure data is stored for that user (Not globally)
and ensure buying a locomotive then shows it in their inventory

game:

- the game loop is simple.
players will first create their company:
players first pick a city (in the USA) to primarily operate out of, their company name and colors
they then start with a basic locomotive, and they can assign it to a job from the job lists. Three Categories: Local Freight, Mainline Freight, Special Freight 
Mainline and Special are locked until a specific user level (Mainline = level 10, Special = level 50)

starting locomotive:
- EMD: GP38-2, 2,000 HP,

all locos will have:
Name / Model
Horsepower
Top Speed
Weight
Fuel Capacity (gals)
Fuel Efficiency
Reliabiltiy 
Maintance Cost ($/mil)
Purchase Cost
Tier / Class

example for the starting loco:
locomotive = {
    "model": "EMD GP38-2",
    "manufacturer": "Electro-Motive Division (EMD)",
    "unit_number": "GP38-2 #2001",
    "tier": 1,  # Local Freight Tier
    "horsepower": 2000,
    "top_speed_mph": 65,
    "weight_tons": 125,
    "tractive_effort_lbs": 61000,
    "fuel_capacity_gal": 2000,
    "fuel_efficiency_gph": 48,  # gallons per hour at full load
    "reliability": 95,  # percent chance of trouble-free run
    "maintenance_cost_per_mile": 1.15,  # dollars per mile
    "purchase_cost": 250000,  # starter cost
    "resale_value": 180000,
    "mileage": 0,
    "paint_condition": 100,  # perfect condition for starter unit
    "livery": {
        "main": "Default Blue",
        "alt": "Industrial Orange (Unlock Level 5)",
        "special": "Heritage Scheme (Unlock Level 10)"
    },
    "status": "available",
    "notes": "Reliable 4-axle road switcher; ideal for shortline and local freight operations."
}



players can see these in their inventory, as well as the shop, and can purhcase more
players start with 500,000 Cash and with that locomotive

jobs will have the type and stuff:
- Job ID / Name
- Origin (players yard)
- Destination
- Distance (miles)
- Freight Type
- Car Count
- HP Count (Minium HP needed, players can assign mutliple locomotives to the job to meet the requirements if needed)
- Time (how long it will take basd on distance and speed of the loco(s))
- Payout ($)
- XP
example:
job = {
    "id": "LCL-001",
    "origin": "Charlotte, NC",
    "destination": "Gastonia Yard",
    "distance_miles": 20,
    "freight_type": "Boxcar (General Goods)",
    "car_count": 6,
    "hp_required": 1200,
    "payout": 2500,
    "time_hours": 0.5,
    "xp_reward": 100,
    "tier": 1,
    "status": "available"
}

when a job is completed, the player gets money and XP from it

site design:
- simplistic but user firendly, dark themed. shhould utilize icons and have realistic and design layout choices

site code should be modular and easily editable. should allow for later events, changes to code, etc. just easily modifiable to help


- when obtaing a locomotive, the loco gets assigned a company ID (Loco ####)
so first locomotive will be: #0001, second would be #0002, etc
this is automatic for each time they buy a locotmotive, the ID is +1 from the previous automatic ID

players can change unit ids (costs $10k), but it cannot match an already existing locotmotive ID

an automatic ID stays, even if a unit before it gets remoed or ID changes, the ID on the other locomotives wont change, they stay until the locotmovie is scrapped / sold, or the ID is change manually


with this:
- in inventory > locomotive, have an option to Sell or Scrap (both return some % of money), this can be used if the locotmovie no longer has life / is unrepairable or if the user just doesnt want it.
- also add the customization menu for locomotives, for now they can only change the locomotive #, but will later be able to change livery


level system changes:
- when a player levels up, have a popup showing that they leveld up, as well as what theyve unlocked (if anything)


ensure players can see thier cash and XP and level


have a simple news system so players can check out updates from the website
