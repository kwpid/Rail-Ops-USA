# Rail Ops: USA - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**Selected Approach: Reference-Based (Simulation Game Aesthetic)**

Drawing inspiration from professional simulation games like Euro Truck Simulator 2, Train Simulator, and management games like Cities: Skylines and Transport Tycoon. The design emphasizes functionality, data clarity, and industrial authenticity while maintaining dark-themed gaming aesthetics.

**Key Design Principles:**
- Industrial Realism: Railroad-inspired color schemes and authentic UI elements
- Data-First Hierarchy: Critical information (cash, XP, level, locomotive stats) immediately visible
- Efficient Navigation: Quick access to inventory, jobs, shop, and company management
- Professional Simulation Feel: Clean, serious interface befitting a management simulator
